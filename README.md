# RRT-processing
In my opinion, best way to learn the algorithm is to implementing it from scrath. As a result I am giving my implementation of RRT algorithm

## How to use
After startup you can press 'q' to start the algorithm
You can add/remove obstacle with mouse1 button or press 'e' to place random obstacles

## Aditional Notes
- Obstacle system is not working as intended hence i do not recommend to add obstacles
- Since new node generation purely by RNG finding path can take time or even cant find it most of times.
